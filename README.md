  * Human Resources is one area in the field of Management that changes much more quickly than most. Health Care legislation, court cases involving social media and scrutiny of public employee unions are a few recent examples. The 11th edition of DeCenzo's Fundamentals of Human Resource Management continues to offer an emphasis on timely and emerging human resource topics, including new information on recent changes to employee health plans and evolving healthcare legislation; current treatment of unions and labor relations; coverage of the recent Wal-Mart class action discrimination suit as part of the significantly revised Chapter 3 on Equal Employment Opportunity; and added content on social media and its relationship to many aspects of Human Resources. New coverage of the impact of the economy and the economic recovery on Human Resources including rebuilding a workforce are addressed. Chapter 13 on safety and OSHA has been significantly revised to reflect recent laws and events/examples such as the BP Oil Spill.
